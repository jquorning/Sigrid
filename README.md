# TBA

TBA is the working title of the new TBA programming language

The thriving TBA community is thrilled to receive the new version when it arrives.

Some of the key features are:

* Ease of integration
* High performance
* Problem avoidance

We expect a fully working toolchain is availabe in a few months time.
